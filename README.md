# This repo is for A/B testing Homework PSS

I create two classes one for Epsilon Gready the other one with changing Epsilon in utils.py.

In the classes there are the pull,update, experement, and report functions.

To run the code make sure you are in the same folder as the code in the terminal/command line and type

## python test.py

and it will giv eyou some results in the terminal/command line.
